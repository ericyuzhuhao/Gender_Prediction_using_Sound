# Gender_Prediction_using_Sound

The following project description was adapted from DataCamp (https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/97).

In this project, genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books were predicted based on pronunciation of names. Predictions were achieved by fuzzy (sound) name matching using the Fuzzy Python package.
